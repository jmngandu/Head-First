Finding syllables is a messy business because the English language is messy. For instance, why does “walked” have
one syllable while “loaded” is two? English is full of such inconsistencies.
For problems like this we don’t write algorithms, we write heuristics. A heuristic is a lot like an algorithm, only it’s
not a 100% solution. It might, for instance, solve a problem with a good answer, but not necessarily a perfect
answer.
